            <h1>Ontology-Based Expert System For Enhanced Disease Diagnosis </h1>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to develop an advanced expert system that utilises ontology-based knowledge representation to assist in the diagnosis of diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The system was designed to provide accurate and detailed diagnostic suggestions, enhancing the process of disease identification and improving the overall user experience.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Deliverables</h2>
                <p>I spearheaded the development of a sophisticated expert system integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline the diagnosis of diseases from symptoms provided by users. The project combines artificial intelligence with ontological engineering to create a comprehensive and intuitive diagnostic tool.</p>
                <p>The system uses medical ontologies to model complex medical knowledge, facilitating detailed symptom-disease mapping. Leveraging the 'Protégé' ontology management tool, I was able to merge and manage intricate ontologies, which significantly enhanced the system’s capability to understand and process a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
                <p>The core of the expert system is a rule-based engine that applies backward chaining logic to infer potential diseases based on user inputs. By integrating ontological data, the system achieves improved accuracy and depth in diagnosis.</p>
                <p>To ensure ease of use, I developed a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter, which allows users to input symptoms easily and receive diagnostic results. The interface was seamlessly integrated with the expert system, displaying both the diagnosis and actionable health information.</p>
