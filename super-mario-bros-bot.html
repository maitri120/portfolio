                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The objective of this project was to develop a bot capable of playing Super Mario Bros using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. The bot was designed to optimise its decision-making process in a dynamic game environment, effectively navigating through the challenges presented in the game.</p>

                <p>Developed the bot in Python, leveraging TensorFlow and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm. A2C was selected for its ability to efficiently handle continuous action spaces, making it ideal for dynamic gaming environments. The project involved experimenting with various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and n-steps, to enhance the bot’s performance. Over the course of training, key metrics like loss value and explained variance were monitored to fine-tune the model, resulting in a significant improvement in gameplay efficiency. The bot was tested and trained within the OpenAI Gym framework, demonstrating its capability to learn and adapt to complex scenarios effectively.</p>
